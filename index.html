    <p class="center">Hello! My name is Stephen Barr, and welcome to my website! It might look a little like a geocities site for now, but I'm just getting started! This is just the first pass of the website, which will only get better with more javascript practice!
    I have already taken to adding some sounds to hover on the buttons above, so give it a try!
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="center">I am currently working coding some scripts involving a gym membership manager, as well as a neverending beep
        machine.
    This is being done under the tutelage of Grand Circus, teaching me the best practices for writing code.
    This text will probably get replaced with actually useful text for job hunting, but for now it is filling in the
        rubric.
    Adequate use of HTML is going to take me longer than a day, but it is definitely interesting to work with!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="center">The true test is to get the sound working. I have always wanted to use TTS and now is the time! Please say this
        works!</p>
